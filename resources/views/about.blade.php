                                <p class="body-text-s margin-top-20 anim-text-reveal tr-delay-02">I began my web
                                    development journey in mid-2022 during my BCA. I started with the MERN stack — React
                                    for interactive UIs and Node/Express for APIs — and spent a focused year mastering
                                    both frontend and backend fundamentals. By the end of 2023 I had completed several
                                    full-stack projects and deepened my problem-solving skills by studying data
                                    structures & algorithms in C++.<br><br>

                                    After graduating with a BCA, I moved into freelancing with friends, working mainly
                                    with PHP/Laravel to gain paid, real-world experience. Over the last 1.5 years I’ve
                                    built admin dashboards, implemented payment integrations, handled wallets and
                                    multi-tier referral systems, and added real-time features using WebSockets. I also
                                    adopted Docker to make development and deployments more predictable.<br><br>

                                    Now I’m enrolled in MCA at University of Kota, exploring Flutter for mobile apps and
                                    continuing DSA practice in Java to strengthen fundamentals further. My path has
                                    been: learn → build → ship → improve.<br><br>

                                    I enjoy turning ambiguous product needs into simple UX and reliable backends: small,
                                    testable components on the frontend, clear REST endpoints on the backend, and
                                    thoughtful database schemas that avoid common pitfalls (N+1 queries, missing
                                    indexes). I prefer shipping usable features quickly and iterating with real user
                                    feedback.<br><br>
